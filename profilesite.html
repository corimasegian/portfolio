    <p> <center> <em> about me </em> </center> </p>

    <p> <center>
      I am a girl who codes from San Jose, California. I am going into my junior year of high school at Branham High, and will be playing field hockey and participating in track there. At home, I enjoy playing video games, reading, writing, and listening to music. I also love to hang out with my friends, and we do all sorts of things together from going to play soccer in the park, having lunch at obscure cafes, or just sitting around and playing Mario Kart!

    <p> <center>
      I really love food, and one of my favorite pastimes is baking banana bread and different kinds of cakes. However, some foods I really dislike, such as cream cheese, mushrooms, and seaweed. I also enjoy reading fiction, particularly realistic or fantasy, but I dislike supernatural stories or overly romantic teen fiction as it is both unrealistic and usually poorly written.
